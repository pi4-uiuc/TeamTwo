Primary goals:
 - Build a support vector machine which will, given traits of a leaf (Carbon-to-Nitrogen ration, leaf biomass area, etc), guess the species of the leaf. 

Data needed:
 - leaf traits, species data
 - Since many traits entries are empty, we need to consider only those species that have enough data available to assign a meaningful value for each variable.
