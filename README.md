# TeamTwo

CONTRIBUTORS:
 - Dakota Ihli
 - Justin Kelm
 - Will Linz
 - Sam Wester

Primary goals:
 - Investigate relationship between planting density (plants / m^2) and crop yield.

Secondary goals:
 - Maximize utility function/yield of crop growth with respect to density.
 - Examining height distribution of crops.
 - Maybe instead investigate the relationship between the planting chemistry and the yield.

Data needed:
 - Crop yield and planting density
