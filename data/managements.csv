To simulate a severe summer drought, we set up three woo-den roof constructions, which were covered with transparent plastic panels during 25 days in July 2008 and in July/August 2009. Each roof construction was ~1.5 m high and had an area of ~100 m2 (Fig. 1). Roofs were built around tree stems and the remaining space between stem and roof was foamed to get a tight sealing. During rain, roof water was collected with gut- ters and transported 50 mdownhill the experimental site. At each subplot, soil temperature was measured at 5 cm

To simulate a severe summer drought, we set up three woo-den roof constructions, which were covered with transparent plastic panels during 25 days in July 2008 and in July/August 2009. Each roof construction was ~1.5 m high and had an area of ~100 m2 (Fig. 1). Roofs were built around tree stems and the remaining space between stem and roof was foamed to get a tight sealing. During rain, roof water was collected with gut- ters and transported 50 mdownhill the experimental site.

To simulate a severe summer drought, we set up three woo-den roof constructions, which were covered with transparent plastic panels during 25 days in July 2008 and in July/August 2009. Each roof construction was ~1.5 m high and had an area of ~100 m2 (Fig. 1). Roofs were built around tree stems and the remaining space between stem and roof was foamed to get a tight sealing. During rain, roof water was collected with gut- ters and transported 50 mdownhill the experimental site.

3047,685,2005-03-01,6.0,warming_soil,"","","Our experiment followed the methods of the Interna- tional Tundra Experiment using open-top chambers (OTC) as a passive warming device to generate an artificially warmed environment. The OTCs were hex- agonal with sloping sides constructed of 3-mm thick translucent Plexiglas (Marion et al. 1997). This material has high solar transmittance in visible wavelengths (about 90%) and low transmittance in the infrared (heat) range (<5%). The chambers were 60 cm high and the distance between parallel sides were 115 cm at the base and 60 cm apart at the top. Each OTC had an open-top area of 1.06 m2 and covered a ground area of 2.45 m2. In March 2005, we installed five OTCs be- neath the 60-year spruce plantation and five OTCs in adjacent forest openings, respectively (in total, ten chambers). Moreover, at each site, a control plot (80 · 80 cm; 0.64 m2) was also established in the vicinity of each OTC; thus, in total, ten control plots were set up. It was expected that all of the selected plots were similar in microhabitat characteristics, with the exception of light environments",2013-04-19 01:31:09 -0500,2014-06-16 17:12:21 -0500
